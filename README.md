---

This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Gomoku** game (also known as Five-in-a-Row) using C++ and the Qt framework. The game is played on a 15x15 board, and the first player to align five of their pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

## Features

- **Player Support**: Two players can play the game, one with black pieces and the other with white pieces.
- **Automatic Win Detection**: The game automatically checks for a win condition after each move.
- **Graphical Interface**: The game features a graphical interface created with Qt, displaying the board and pieces with smooth graphics.
- **Responsive Input**: The game responds to mouse clicks, allowing players to place their pieces on the board.
